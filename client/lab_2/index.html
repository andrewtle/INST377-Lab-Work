    <h2> Let's Try Some Inline Elements </h2>
    
    <p> Sometimes you want to <em>draw attention to something</em> in a line of text. </p>

    <p> Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text. </p>

    <p>Sometimes you want to <em><strong> do both</strong></em>.</p>

    <h2> Empty Elements </h2>

    Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. <br/> Neither can image tags, or hard lines. <br/>
    Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample. <hr/>

    <h2> Images </h2>

    <p> Include the four images from the links and images tutorial below. </p>
    
    <p> Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility. </p>
